# Test-executables will track a list of program tests.
test-executables:
  # Each program test will have to have the program-name, and the test-cases.
  # Note: Only the path to the program is really necessary. It's assumed it is located at the output executables dir.
  - program: "t1.exe"
    # <t1.exe> will sum all arguments. It returns 0 by default, in case of none.

    tests:
      # Each test case have the input and the expected output.
      - input: ["123", "345", "567"]
        output: "1035"

      # Shouldn't trigger failure, as simple strings won't be passed as args.
      - input: "anything"
        output: "0"

      # Invalid IO responses
      - input: ["anything"]
        output: "1"

      - input: ["123", "345", "nothing"]

      # If the input is put alone, without the output counterpart, then the program will be attempted to be run without
      # comparing its final output result.

    tests:
